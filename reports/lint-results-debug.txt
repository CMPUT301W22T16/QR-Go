/home/runner/work/QR-Go/QR-Go/src/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_maps.xml:2: Warning: Replace the <fragment> tag with FragmentContainerView. [FragmentTagUsage from fragment-1.3.6]
<fragment xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
 ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "FragmentTagUsage":
   FragmentContainerView replaces the <fragment> tag as the preferred         
          way of adding fragments via XML. Unlike the <fragment> tag,
   FragmentContainerView                 uses a normal FragmentTransaction
   under the hood to add the initial fragment,                 allowing
   further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView        
           and providing a consistent timing for lifecycle events.

/home/runner/work/QR-Go/QR-Go/src/app/build.gradle:38: Warning: A newer version of com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps than 17.0.1 is available: 18.0.2 [GradleDependency]

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.
